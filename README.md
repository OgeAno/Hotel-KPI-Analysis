# Hotel-KPI-Analysis
## Data Preparation using R    
Using a public hotel dataset which can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jessemostipak/hotel-booking-demand), the goal of this analysis was to look at the trend in three KPIs:     
i).      The Number of Rooms Booked per month    
ii). The Average Daily Rates    
iii).The Revenue generated from room occupancy    
For this analysis, I selected the 2-year period from **July, 2015 to June, 2017** for the **Resort Hotel**. I used R for data cleaning and preparation. The [Jupyter Notebook](https://github.com/OgeAno/Hotel-KPI-Analysis/blob/a50675c005f97728de5d8f811cb4850295b8efd8/Hotel_Booking.ipynb) shows the data preparation steps I took using R.     
After I was done with data preparation, I exported the final dataset to Tableau for visualisation.
